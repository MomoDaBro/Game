## Part 1
There will be 3 main parts to each level
the first part will be the character you play as
The componets that make up the character stage are as follows
Hitpoints, how much health you currently have should be stated after every turn
Turn Options, the four actions that can be chosen during your turn
These four options are Attack, dealing a static amount of damage unless increased with means later on mentioned (maybe crits..?)
Blocking is the second option, allowing the user to take less damage, this amount can also be scaled later through means
Item, allowing a user to use an item in their inventory, this action does not consume a turn
Escape, Escape essentially ends the game allowing a user to restart.
## Part 2
Part two consists of the enemies that you will face upon playing.
The compentnets that make up the enemies are as follows
First the number of enemies that you take on at once will be determined
Easier and beginner levels will contain one enemy while as you progress you can get more enemies to appear
Damage: Enemies will deal static damage unless affected by an item, harder enemies deal more damage
There will be three base types of enemies, a melee unit, a ranged unit, and a magic unit.
Bosses may be implemted but not fully thought out just yet.
## Part 3
The last part is items as previously mentioned.
After an enemy is slain it will have a chance of dropping an item based on its class.
The current items accessible are, Regen potions, Defense up, Attack up, Clear Effect, Spell card
